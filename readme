My personal webserver, using:
Python 3.2
Django 1.7
Python-Markdown 2.4.1


Database notes:
Front page body is under key "front_body" in table "frontpage_data"

Settings:
Settings are located in /etc/personalsite:
    lastfm_api_key.txt has the api key needed for pulling data from lastfm
    personalsite.sqlite3 is the database for the site
    django_secret_key.txt is Django's secret key

All of these are imported in the settings files

For the admin page, the default user is root, with a password of admin. Obviously you can create your own using Django's
create super user functionality.

Files that will need to be edited and copied without the .template extension when setting up:
    testing\salt\roots\personalsite_conf\django_secret_key.txt.template (should change when moving to production)
    testing\salt\roots\personalsite_conf\lastfm_api_key.txt.template (must get API key from last.fm)
    testing\salt\roots\personalsite_conf\personalsite.sqlite3.template (can be copied directly)
