My personal webserver, using:
Python 3.3.3 
Django 1.6.5
Python-Markdown 2.4.1


Database notes:
Front page body is under key "front_body" in table "frontpage_data"


Settings:
Settings are located in /etc/personalsite:
    lastfm_api_key.txt has the api key needed for pulling data from lastfm
    personalsite.sqlite3 is the database for the site
    django_secret_key.txt is Django's secret key

All of these are imported in the settings files
